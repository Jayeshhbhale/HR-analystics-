# HR Analytics Project

Welcome to the **HR Analytics** repository! This project focuses on analyzing employee data to derive meaningful insights, improve decision-making, and support HR strategies. The data set used is vast and detailed, allowing for a wide range of analyses.

## Power BI Analysis Overview

I have developed the following Power BI worksheets:

1. **Dashboard**: A high-level overview of key HR metrics, including employee demographics, performance, attrition rates, and satisfaction scores.
2. **Deep Analysis Dashboard**: A more granular breakdown of important factors like department-specific trends, tenure analysis, and detailed attrition drivers.
3. **Report**: A detailed report that captures insights from various angles, summarizing overall trends and outliers across the organization.

## Next Steps for Further Analysis

The data is extensive, and I believe thereâ€™s much more potential for deeper analysis. Here are some ideas for additional charts and insights that could be included:

- **Attrition Prediction Model**: Develop a predictive model using historical data to identify the likelihood of employee turnover.
- **Employee Satisfaction vs. Performance**: Analyze the relationship between employee satisfaction scores and performance ratings across different teams or departments.
- **Diversity and Inclusion Analysis**: Create visualizations that highlight diversity metrics such as gender, ethnicity, and age group, and explore their impact on team dynamics and performance.
- **Tenure vs. Attrition Analysis**: A deeper look at how employee tenure correlates with attrition risk, broken down by job roles or departments.
- **Promotion and Career Growth Trends**: Visualize promotion frequency and career progression over time, exploring how these impact employee retention and satisfaction.
- **Department-Wise Performance Comparison**: Compare key performance indicators (KPIs) across departments to identify areas for improvement or best practices.
- **Employee Absenteeism Analysis**: Dive into absenteeism trends, exploring potential factors such as department, seniority, or job role.
- **Compensation vs. Performance**: Examine compensation levels relative to performance, identifying trends and potential gaps across different levels of the organization.
- **Skills Gap Analysis**: Use employee skill data to identify gaps in skills required versus available, and recommend potential training or hiring needs.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the Power BI file to see the current dashboards and add your own insights! Contributions or suggestions for further analysis are always welcome. If you'd like to collaborate or have ideas for improving this project, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
